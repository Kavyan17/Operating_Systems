# Operating_Systems
Designed and implemented a multi-phase Operating Systems project, using C programming and Unix shell
scripting, starting with CPU and memory simulation, extending to multi-process execution with CPU
scheduling, integrating socket programming for multiple computers and printers, and culminating in a memory
manager for optimal process allocation.
